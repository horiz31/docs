## How to setup VLC to playback multicast stream from vehicle

1. Download and install VLC https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
2. Download the sdp file, for vehicle "Demo 1" (169.216) 

Notes, it is not fully understood how VLC picks an interface (or interfaces) to use for mulicate group joins. Therefore we recommend that you use this setup on a PC with only one network interface.
